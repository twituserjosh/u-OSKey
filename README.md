# u\OSKey
Batch File that pulls Windows OS Product-Keys from:
- [x] Windows 7
- [x] Windows 8
- [x] Windows 8.1
- [x] Windows 10 

This is used to quickly pull the OS Product key which saves them all in a .txt file.
This was originally created for when discarding OLD windows PCs to save the product key for later.

How to use:
1) Download OSKey.bat file
2) Run OSKey.bat file as administrator
3) ProductKeys.txt are saved to the same location as the OSKey.bat File

Ideally Save & run this off a flash drive in a folder named "OSKey" where the .bat and .txt file will be saved together!
